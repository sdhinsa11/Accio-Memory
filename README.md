# **Accio Memory**

**Welcome to my memory game built for the Odin Project!**

During this game users can take select the level they want and then try to select all the different cards (if they remember which cards they have not clicked yet).
You win by selecting all the different cards, and the game ends if you select a card you've already selected. The cards randomly shuffle after each click to make it
a bit more challenging!
